</div>

The project leverages Docker Volumes to enable data persistence in containerized environments. By decoupling the data from the container filesystem, we ensure that data remains intact even when containers are deleted or recreated. The architecture consists of the following key components:

- **Host Machine**: The underlying infrastructure that hosts the Docker containers and volumes.
- **Docker Containers**: Isolated runtime environments that encapsulate the application and its dependencies.
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage mechanism that allows data to be shared and reused across containers.
- **Apache Cassandra**: A highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database for handling large amounts of structured data.

### 🗃️ Data Persistence with Docker Volumes

Docker Volumes provide a powerful way to store data outside the container's filesystem. By creating and mounting volumes, we can ensure that data persists even when containers are deleted or recreated. This project demonstrates how to create and manage Docker Volumes effectively.

### 🚀 Seamless Integration with Apache Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is a robust NoSQL database known for its scalability and high availability. This project showcases the seamless integration of Docker Volumes with Cassandra, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. By running Cassandra containers with mounted volumes, we ensure data durability and fault tolerance.

### 📊 Keyspace Management and Data Recovery

The project delves into keyspace management and data recovery scenarios. Through hands-on examples, you'll learn how to create and verify keyspaces in Cassandra, demonstrating data persistence by recreating containers. The project also explores data recovery techniques, ensuring the integrity and availability of your data.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Usage</strong></summary>

1. Create a Docker Volume:
   ```bash
   docker volume create --driver local --label example=cassandra cass-shared
   ```
2. Run a Cassandra container with the volume mounted:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --volume cass-shared:/var/lib/cassandra/data --name cass1 cassandra:2.2
   ```
3. Connect to the Cassandra container using CQLSH:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --link cass1:cass cassandra:2.2 cqlsh cass
   ```
4. Perform database operations, create keyspaces, and verify data persistence.

For more advanced usage and detailed instructions, please refer to the project documentation.
